# EPW_PostProcess
A collection of scripts to post-process the output from Quantum ESPRESSO's EPW code


#Capabilities:
- FS_gap.py: reads a file like filename = "ncn.imag_aniso_gap_FS_003.00" and plots Fermi Surface and colors it with corresponding anisotropic superconducting gap function. Asks the user to enter the viewing angles (theta and phi) to tilt the projection plane on which the Fermi surface is projected.
